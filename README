This is absolutely experimental code. It is just public in case someone
is interested in development.

This repository contains the beginning of a django application that can be
used as a frontend for SDAPS. Some of the basic ideas:
 * Leave the current SDAPS codebase pretty much unchanged for now.
   This primarily means we do not touch the data model for now, and
   stay with the pickled data storage.
   This probably means that storing corrections will be very inefficient
   for now.
 * Editing is done by dynamically building a LaTeX file for the questions.
   Questionnaires can be designed directly in django.
   Previewing is done using pdf.js.
 * backbone.js seems like a sane way for some of the data model needs
   (questionnaire creation and correction).
 * Long running tasks are executed in the background using celery.

Anyone interested in moving this forwared please drop me a line. Note that I
have not yet attached a license to it (probably GPLv3+, but I am thinking
about using some AGPL like license).

Well, that is about it for now.
